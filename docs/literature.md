Summary:
Evaluates RAG-based systems for assessing regulatory compliance of FDA drug labeling and clinical trial protocols. 
Compares RAG outputs to GPT-4o without retrieval and uses ROUGE-L, METEOR, and LLM-as-judge metrics.

Relevance to Thesis:
- Directly applies RAG to regulatory document compliance
- Evaluates grounded outputs against FDA guidance
- Operates in pharmaceutical domain (high-stakes setting)
